# ChartTracker

The idea for my website is to create a space where music chart data can be found in one central location.  In addition, this website would not focus on just one particular music chart but would include chart data from many of the various genres of music charts over the years.  Much of the data that is out there now can be viewed but cannot be sorted or customized based on user preferences.  The goal would be for this website to bridge this current gap.
I foresee there being many ways that this website can grow over time.  

With that in mind, the initial website will consist of the following features:
    •	Access to data from the following charts:  Hot 100 Singles, Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks, and Hot Country Songs.
    •	The initial data set will focus on chart data available from the 1980s.
    •	Data can be viewed for individual weekly charts, yearly charts, or a decade chart.
    •	Yearly and decade charts will incorporate a custom tabulation method that I am creating.
    •	View chart data associated with specific artists.
    •	A user form allowing users to make requests for other chart offerings.

Later versions of the website will incorporate the following additional features:
    •	Access to additional charts from Billboard and other sources.
    •	Access to data from all available chart years.
    •	Create charts based on user-customized date ranges.
    •	Create a list of songs available on various music services.  If the APIs of the music services allow, this will include 
        the ability to create playlists for those music services.
